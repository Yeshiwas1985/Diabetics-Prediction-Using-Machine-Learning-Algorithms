# Diabetics-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project is developed to predict four types of diabetes using Machine Learning algorithms.
## Data Collection:
A total of more than 10,000 diabetic data were collected from Addis Ababa (Capital city of Ethiopia) hospitals
## Data Preprocessing:
Different data preprocessing methods were applied. such as filling missing values by calculating the mean of the entire column
## Algorithms used:
### 1. SVM
### 2.  Na√Øve Bayes
### 3. Decision Tree
### 4. KNN
